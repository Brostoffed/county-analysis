## Overview
Making public property information transparent and digestible.

## Los Angeles County
We're going to be pulling information about parcels from two county agencies.
- Auditor Controller: https://auditor.lacounty.gov
- Assessor: https://portal.assessor.lacounty.gov
    - GIS: https://maps.assessor.lacounty.gov/m/
- Los Angeles Open Data Portal: https://data.lacity.org/browse?category=Housing+and+Real+Estate

### Overview
For the fiscal year of 2022-23, there are over 500 different county and city agencies that can be added to a property tax bill. We are going to scrape, download, clean, and then analyze the property data for over 2,000,000 parcels.

## Notes
- I haven't been able to find a concise 1-to-1 mapping for auditor agency number to agency name.
